    "## Problem Description\n",
    "The Towers of Hanoi is one of the most famous classic problems every budding computer scientist must grapple with. Legend has it that in a temple in the Far East, priests are attempting to move a stack of golden disks from one diamond peg to another. (fig1\n",

    "\n",
    "fig1\n",
    "The initial stack has 64 disks threaded onto one peg and arranged from bottom to top by decreasing size. The priests are attempting to move the stack from one peg to another under the constraints that exactly one disk is moved at a time and at no time may a larger disk be placed above a smaller disk. Three pegs are provided, one being used for temporarily holding disks. Supposedly, the world will end when the priests complete their task, so there is little incentive for us to facilitate their efforts.\n",
    "Let’s assume that the priests are attempting to move the disks from peg1 to peg3. We wish to develop an algorithm that prints the precise sequence of peg-to-peg disk transfers.\n",
    "\tIf we were to approach this problem with conventional methods, we would rapidly find ourselves hopelessly knotted up in managing the disks. Instead, attacking this problem with recursion in mind allows the step to be simple. Moving n disks can be viewed in terms of moving only n-1 disks (hence, the recursion), as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    a)\tMove n-1 disks from peg1 to peg2, using peg3 as a temporary holding area.\n",
    "    b)\tMove the last disk (the largest) from peg1 to peg3.\n",
    "    c)\tMove the n-1 disks from peg2 to peg3, using peg1 as a temporary holding area.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The process ends when the last task involves moving n = 1 disk (i.e., the base case). This task is accomplished by simply moving the disk, without the need for a temporary holding area. Write a program to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem.\n",
    "Use a recursive function with four parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a)\tThe number of disks to be moved\n",
    "    b)\tThe peg on which these disks are initially threaded\n",
